# Convolutional-LSTM-in-Tensorflow
This branch has a much better network architeture that uses convolutional LSTM. Here is a picture of the new network.

To train just run `python main_train.py`. I might change the model in master to this one in a little bit. Here is a video it generates. It seems to perform much better.

Here is a comparison of the learning curves for the recurrent model in master and this one (no contest).
